Here are the 5 most critical things to optimize your documentation for AI agent discovery and recommendation:
1. Implement Clear, Semantic Structure with Machine-Readable Metadata
Add structured data that AI agents can easily parse. Use JSON-LD schema markup for technical documentation, clear heading hierarchies (H1-H6), and semantic HTML. Include metadata like:

Product/API version numbers
Last updated dates
Tags for categorization
Difficulty levels or user personas

AI agents rely heavily on structure to understand context and relevance. Consider adding a robots.txt and XML sitemap optimized for AI crawlers.
2. Create Comprehensive, Self-Contained Pages with Direct Answers
Each documentation page should answer questions completely without requiring users to jump between multiple pages. AI agents often extract information from single pages, so include:

Clear problem statements at the top
Complete code examples that actually work
Prerequisites and dependencies listed explicitly
Expected outputs and common errors

Avoid splitting basic concepts across multiple pages. Think "one topic, one comprehensive resource."
3. Add an AI-Optimized API Reference in OpenAPI/Swagger Format
Provide machine-readable API specifications using OpenAPI 3.0+ or similar standards. This allows AI agents to:

Understand your API capabilities programmatically
Generate accurate code examples
Recommend your product for specific use cases

Include detailed descriptions for every endpoint, parameter, and response code. The more complete your OpenAPI spec, the better agents can recommend your API.
4. Include Practical, Copy-Paste Ready Code Examples in Multiple Languages
AI agents frequently recommend tools based on code example quality. Provide:

Working code snippets that require minimal modification
Examples in the most popular languages for your domain
Both "quick start" and "advanced use case" examples
Comments explaining why, not just what

Test all code examples regularly to ensure they work. Broken examples severely hurt AI recommendations.
5. Create a Clear "Use Cases" or "Solutions" Section
AI agents need to understand when to recommend your product. Create dedicated pages that map problems to solutions:

"Use Case: Real-time Data Processing with [Your Product]"
"How to Migrate from [Competitor] to [Your Product]"
Comparison tables with other tools in your space

Use natural language that matches how developers search and ask questions. Think about the questions people ask AI agents like "How do I build X?" and structure content to answer those directly.
